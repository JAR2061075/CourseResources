        <h2>Generic Font Families</h2>
        <p>There are several font family types that can be designated for html content, some of the more common ones include: Serif, Sans-Serif, Proportional and Monospace. Serif-family fonts include letters with serifs on the ends like a little flag. Sans-serif (as in without) indicates font letters that don't include these flags. Proportional refers to font spacing. In this family a letter occupies space proportional to its size. So for example, a wide letter takes up more space than narrower letters. Monospace on the other hand uses an identical amount of space for each letter no matter its shape ("Lesson 5," 2022).</p><br>
        <h2>Applying Color</h2>
        <p>There are 3 different ways color can be added inline to HTML content: RBG, Hexadecimal, and Common color names. All three color options must start with the CSS property used to colorize text: "color:." RGB utilizes 3 color values laid on top of each other to create a color mix. These color "channels" are: red, green and blue ("Lesson 5," 2022). Hexadecimal color values are represented by codes that include letters, numbers or a combination of the two. The letters range from A-F and the numbers range from 0-9. The code must be preclassified with a "#" symbol. An example is: <span style="color:#E60000">#E60000</span> ("Lesson 5," 2022).The final and simplest wat to add color is use color names, 140 unique color names are available such as <span style="color:navy"><b>Navy Blue</b></span> ("Lesson 5," 2022).  </p> <!--Saving completion of part 1 of Lesson 5.
